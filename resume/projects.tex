    {As a tech lover, I like to keep myself always up to date with latest technologies and experimenting with it. This led me through various kind of personal projects, like prototyping a motorcycle replacement dashboard with python, QT and the serial OBD2 interface, or developing a Google Home integrated LED stripe managed by a RaspberryPi.}
